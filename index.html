<p> My village is a place that I like to visit in my holidays or whenever I feel tired and want to relax.</p><br>
 <p>A village is a place that is far away from the pollution and noise of the city. Also, you feel a connection with the soil in a village.</p><br>

<p> there are trees, a variety of crops, diversity of flowers, and rivers, etc.Besides all this, you feel the cold breeze at night and a warm but pleasant breeze in the day.</p><br><p> Around more than 70% of Indiaâ€™s population resides in villages. Likewise, villages are the main source of food and agricultural produce that we consume.</p><br>
 <p>After independence, the villages have grown much in both populations as well as education.

Village peoples are more dedicated to their work then the people of the city also they have more strength and capacity then urban area people</p><br> Moreover, the entire village lives in peace and harmony and there is no conflict of any kind. Villagers come forward in each other sorrows and happiness and they are of helpful nature. Most importantly, you can see stars at night which you no longer see in the city.
